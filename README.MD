# Kiss-Anime video Loader

This chrome extension is made to circumvent the problems kiss anime has been showing lately, like memory leaks and the increasingly sketchy ads.

To use this extension:
-  download and unzip this into a chosen folder
-  open chrome and go to manage extensions
-  click on the developer mode checkbox on the top right of the browser
-  click on the Load unpacked extension
-  browse till you find the folder you just downloaded
-  enjoy ^O^


This only works with kiss anime and it works best with rapidvideo. It does NOT work with the beta server. Other streaming options work okay, it does not get rid of the sketchy ads when you press play for now.
