# Kiss-Anime video Loader

This chrome extension is made to circumvent the problems kiss anime has been showing lately, like memory leaks and the increasingly sketchy ads.

To use this extension:
-  download and unzip this into a chosen folder
-  open chrome and go to manage extensions
-  click on the developer mode checkbox on the top right of the browser
-  click on the Load unpacked extension
-  browse till you find the folder you just downloaded
-  enjoy ^O^

This only works with kiss anime and it works best with rapid video.
It does not work with the beta and alpha servers.
Other streaming options should work well enough.
On other streaming options besides rapid video, ads might still show.
(but the memory leak problems should be solved)
